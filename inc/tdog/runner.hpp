 * automatically register themselves with the global runner object
 * when they are instantiated.
 *
 * \details When you declare a test case with TDOG_TEST_CASE() or TDOG_TEST_FIXTURE(),
 * for example, a C++ class is instantiated and your assert statements will
 * form part of the class implementation. You would not normally need to access
 * the underlying class instance directly, however, as these objects "self-register"
 * with a global tdog::runner object which provides the means to run the
 * tests. However, if you wish to register test cases explicitly with a runner
 * yourself (rather than have them register themselves), then you will need
 * a mechanism by which to access to the underlying test instance, and
 * the TDOG_GET_TCPTR() macro provides this. The TDOG library uses this
 * in order to test itself, but it is not generally needed by client
 * applications.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to register a test case explicitly with the
 * runner using this macro. Note that in order to make tests non self-registering,
 * you must declare them inside the scope of TDOG_EXPLICIT_SUITE().
 *
 * \code
 * #include <tdog.hpp>
 *
 * TDOG_EXPLICIT_SUITE(suite_name)
 * {
 *   // Define test
 *   TDOG_TEST_CASE(some_test)
 *   {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Must close the suite
 *   TDOG_CLOSE_SUITE
 * }
 *
 *
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   // Explicitly register with non-global runner
 *   tdog::runner tr;
 *   tr.register_test(TDOG_GET_TCPTR(suite_name::some_test));
 *   ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Tests within sub-suites of the TDOG_EXPLICIT_SUITE() will also
 * require explicit registration with a runner, irrespective of
 * whether the sub-suite is declared using TDOG_SUITE() or
 * TDOG_EXPLICIT_SUITE(). Tests in the global suite namespace cannot
 * be made "explicit", and will always self-register.
 *
 * The test case instance must exist for the lifetime of the runner class.

 * - To match all tests in a suite, including its sub-suites, suffix the name
