ABOUT TDOG
###############################

TDOG is a lightweight, portable and open source C++ xUnit Testing
Framework. It features:

 - Macros for easy unit test creation
 - C++ namespaced test suites (test groups)
 - Test fixtures
 - Test, suite & global level setup/teardown
 - Repeated tests
 - Multi-report generation:
   - Text
   - HTML
   - JUnit/Jenkins compatible XML
 - Comprehensive range of asserts macros
 - Test specific and global time limits
 - Test time warnings
 - Exceptions (i.e. "throw" and "no throw" tests)
 - Not dependendent on RTTI
 - Lightweight & highly portable
 - No dependencies on other libraries or tools
 - Comprehensive documentation
 - Unencumbered open source license

TDOG is maintained for g++ for LINUX, MSVC and MinGW on Windows.
It can be found at: http://bigangrydog.com

See the "index.html" under "doc" for documentation.


###############################
BUILDING
###############################

To build the TDOG static library on LINUX, from the "tdog" directory, simply call:

make

Then build the self-test application, with:

make CONF=selftest.conf

Alternatively, to build everything in one step, use:

make rebuildall CONF=selftest.conf

Under MinGW on Windows, use "mingw32-make" instead.

This will build a "release" version of the software. To build with debug
information, append "TARGET=debug" to the above. You can also cross-compile
for both 32 and 64 bits by appending "ARCH=32" or "ARCH=64". See the
"makefile.readme" for more information about the make configuration.

Project files also exist for MSVC 2013, under the "mvc" directory. These
target MD and MT, 32 and 64 bit, and "release" and "debug".

TDOG uses the STL and exceptions. However, it does not need RTTI (run-time
type indentification) or C++11 features.

Once built, you can run the binary under the "bin" directory to perform
a self-test of the framework. Test reports will be generated to the
"bin/reports" directory. Run "selftest" directly from "bin", so that
this is the working directory. The tests will generate one "warning",
which is intentional.

*Does not support contiguous suites under BCB. Also found the Windows Sleep call inaccurate under XP.
